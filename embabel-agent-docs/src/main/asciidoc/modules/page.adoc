=== Embabel Modules

Embabel spans multiple modules, in this and other repositories in the `embabel` organization.

The status of these modules varies.
There are three statuses:

- *Stable*: these modules are considered production ready.
We strive to avoid breaking changes.
- *Incubating*: these modules are under active development and may have breaking changes in minor releases.
However, they are considered generally usable and can be expected to graduate to stable.
Use with caution.
- *Experimental*: these modules are early stage and may have breaking changes in any release.
They are not recommended for production use.
These modules may be removed without replacement and there is no guarantee of them graduating to a more stable status.

Of course, contributions are welcome to all modules!

==== Experimental APIs

While the status of modules may change over time, any module may contain clearly identified experimental functionality.
This enables us to innovate in the open without excessive build complexity.

Please try and provide feedback on this functionality, but don't rely on it and be aware that it may change without notice.

IMPORTANT: Any type or method annotated with the `@ApiStatus.Experimental` annotation is not guaranteed to be stable.
