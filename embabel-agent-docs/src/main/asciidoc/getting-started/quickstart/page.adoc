=== Quickstart

There are two GitHub template repos you can use to create your own project:

* Java template - https://github.com/embabel/java-agent-template
* Kotlin template - https://github.com/embabel/kotlin-agent-template

Or you can use our https://github.com/embabel/project-creator[project creator] to create a custom project:

[source,bash]
----
uvx --from git+https://github.com/embabel/project-creator.git project-creator
----
NOTE: The `uvx` command can be installed from the https://docs.astral.sh/uv/[astral-uv] package. It is a Python package and project manager used to run the Embabel https://github.com/embabel/project-creator[project creator] scripts.

Now you have the code you need to run Embabel with LLMs from Open AI or Anthropic by using the included Maven profiles. Skip ahead to <<reference.environment_setup, Environment Setup>> for API-key configuration, or detailed instructions on how to use other LLM providers.
