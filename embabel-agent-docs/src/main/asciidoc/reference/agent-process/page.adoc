=== The AgentProcess

An `AgentProcess` is created every time an agent is run.
It has a unique id.

=== ProcessOptions

Agent processes can be configured with `ProcessOptions`.

`ProcessOptions` controls:

* `contextId`: An identifier of any existing context in which the agent is running.
* `blackboard`: The blackboard to use for the agent.
Allows starting from a particular state.
* `test`: Whether the agent is running in test mode.
* `verbosity`: The verbosity level of the agent.
Allows fine grained control over logging prompts, LLM returns and detailed planning information
* `control`: Control options, determining whether the agent should be terminated as a last resort. `EarlyTerminationPolicy` can based on an absolute number of actions or a maximum budget.
* Delays: Both operations (actions) and tools can have delays.
This is useful to avoid rate limiting.
