=== Working with LLM Reasoning / Thinking

==== Concepts

- ```ThinkingBlock``` - abstraction that carries details on LLM reasoning, including Tag type, Tag value, and LLM reasoning text
- ```ThinkingTags``` - reasoning Tag Types and XML tags definition. Dynamic tags got supported as well
- ```ResponseWithThinking``` - LLM response holder, wraps Object and List of ```ThinkingBlocks```
- ```ThinkingException``` - wraps Thinking Blocks in case Object cant be instantiated
- ```withThinking``` - Core ```PromptRunner``` API


==== Example on handling Object and Thinking Blocks
[source,java]
----

        // Use the LLM configured for thinking tests
        PromptRunner runner = ai.withLlm("claude-sonnet-4-5")
                                .withToolObject(Tooling.class);

        String prompt = "Think about the coldest month in Alaska and its temperature. Provide your analysis.";

        //Use builder for  natural chaining
        ThinkingResponse<MonthItem> response = runner
                .withThinking()
                .createObjectIfPossible(prompt, MonthItem.class);


        MonthItem result = response.getResult();

        List<ThinkingBlock> thinkingBlocks = response.getThinkingBlocks();
