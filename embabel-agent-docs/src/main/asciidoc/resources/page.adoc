Discusses the long-term goals and strategic direction of the project.

- https://medium.com/@springrod/context-engineering-needs-domain-understanding-b4387e8e4bf8[Context Engineering Needs Domain Understanding] - Deep dive into the DICE (Domain-Integrated Context Engineering) concept and why domain understanding is fundamental to effective context engineering in AI systems.

=== Examples and Tutorials

- https://www.baeldung.com/java-embabel-agent-framework[Creating an AI Agent in Java Using Embabel Agent Framework] by Baeldung - A nice introductory example, in Java.
- https://jettro.dev/building-agents-with-embabel-a-hands-on-introduction-4f96d2edeac0[Building Agents With Embabel: A Hands-On Introduction] by Jettro Coenradie - An excellent Java tutorial.

==== Embabel Agent Examples Repository

The https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent-examples[Examples Repository] is a comprehensive collection of example agents demonstrating different aspects of the framework:

- **Beginner Examples**: Simple horoscope agents showing basic concepts
- **Intermediate Examples**: Multi-LLM research agents with self-improvement
- **Advanced Examples**: Fact-checking agents with parallel verification and confidence scoring
- **Integration Examples**: Agents that use web tools, databases, and external APIs

Perfect starting point for learning Embabel development with hands-on examples.

==== Java Agent Template

https://github.com/embabel/java-agent-template[Template repository] for creating new Java-based Embabel agents.
Includes:

- Pre-configured project structure
- Example WriteAndReviewAgent demonstrating multi-LLM workflows
- Build scripts and Docker configuration
- Getting started documentation

==== Kotlin Agent Template

https://github.com/embabel/kotlin-agent-template[Template repository] for Kotlin-based agent development with similar features to the Java template but using idiomatic Kotlin patterns.

=== Sophisticated Example: Tripper Travel Planner

==== Tripper - AI-Powered Travel Planning Agent

https://github.com/embabel/tripper[Tripper] is a production-quality example demonstrating advanced Embabel capabilities:

**Features:**

- Generates personalized travel itineraries using multiple AI models
- Integrates web search, mapping, and accommodation search
- Modern web interface built with htmx
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

**Technical Highlights:**

- Uses both Claude Sonnet and GPT-4.1-mini models

- Shows how to build user-facing applications with Embabel
- Practical example of deterministic planning with AI

**Learning Value:**

- Real-world application of Embabel concepts
- Integration patterns with external services
- Production deployment considerations
- User interface design for AI applications

=== Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)

- Here's an https://medium.com/@vedantchaudhari/goal-oriented-action-planning-34035ed40d0b[Introduction to GOAP], the planning algorithm used by Embabel.
Explains the core concepts and why GOAP is effective for AI agent planning.

==== Small Language Model Agents - NVIDIA Research

- This https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents/[Research paper] discusses the division between "code agency" and "LLM agency" - concepts that inform Embabel's architecture.

==== OODA Loop - Wikipedia

Here's a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop[Background] on the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop that underlies Embabel's replanning approach.

=== Domain-Driven Design

- Martin Fowler's https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html[Foundational concepts of Domain-Driven Design] provides a good summary of Embabel's approach to domain modeling.

==== Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software

- Eric Evans' https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215[seminal book] on DDD principles.
Essential reading for understanding how to model complex domains effectively.

==== DDD and Contextual Validation

- https://www.infoq.com/articles/ddd-contextual-validation/[Advanced DDD concepts] relevant to building sophisticated domain models for AI agents.
