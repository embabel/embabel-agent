/**
 * Callback interface for interleaving logic with the lifecycle of an AgentProcess and its actions.
 *
 * This is particularly useful for ConcurrentAgentProcess, where launched actions run in their own threads and may,
 * for example, need a Spring Security context proliferated to the thread in which the action runs:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @Component
 * @Scope("prototype")
 * class SecurityContextAgentProcessCallback : AgentProcessCallback {
 *     var securityContext: SecurityContext? = null
 *
 *     override fun beforeActionLaunched(process: AgentProcess) {
 *         securityContext = SecurityContextHolder.getContext()
 *     }
 *
 *     override fun onActionLaunched(
 *         process: AgentProcess,
 *         action: Action,
 *     ) {
 *         securityContext?.let {
 *             SecurityContextHolder.setContext(it)
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     override fun onActionCompleted(
 *         process: AgentProcess,
 *         action: Action,
 *     ) {
 *         SecurityContextHolder.clearContext()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
