# Embabel Agent Examples

This module provides a suite of example agents and supporting code to demonstrate how to use the [Embabel Agent](https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent) framework for building agentic flows in both Java and Kotlin. The examples are organized by language and domain, allowing you to quickly learn, test, and extend agent functionality.

---

## Directory Structure

- **examples-common/**  
  Shared utilities and code used across multiple examples.

- **examples-dependencies/**  
  Maven dependency management for example submodules.

- **examples-java/**  
  Java-based agent examples.

- **examples-kotlin/**  
  Kotlin-based agent examples and DSL demonstrations.

- **pom.xml**  
  Maven configuration for building and managing all examples.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or newer
- Maven 3.9+
- [Embabel Agent Parent Project](https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent) checked out and built locally

### Building the Examples

To build all examples:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Or, to build a specific example directory:

```bash
cd examples-kotlin
mvn clean install
```

## Running Example Agents

Several startup scripts are provided in the `embabel-agent-api/scripts` directory to make it easy to run the shell with the example agents enabled. These scripts set up environment variables and Maven profiles to activate different agent examples.

### Usage via Provided Scripts

#### Unix/Linux/macOS

```bash
cd ../embabel-agent-api/scripts
./shell.sh
```

#### Windows (CMD)

```cmd
cd ..\embabel-agent-api\scripts
shell.cmd
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
cd ..\embabel-agent-api\scripts
.\shell.ps1
```

#### Docker-Desktop Profile (CMD)

```cmd
cd ..\embabel-agent-api\scripts
shell_docker.cmd
```

Each script activates relevant Spring profiles (such as `shell`, `starwars`, `severance`, or `docker-desktop`) and the Maven profile `agent-examples-kotlin` to include the example agents in the shell.

## Example Projects

- **Dogfood Agent (Kotlin):** Demonstrates a simple agent workflow in Kotlin.
- **Horoscope Agent (Java & Kotlin):** Sample agent providing horoscope data.
- **Movie Agent (Kotlin):** Movie recommendation agent.
- **Travel Agent (Kotlin):** Travel advice and planning agent.

These examples cover prompt engineering, tool integration, and orchestration patterns using Embabel Agent.

## Maven Profiles

Example agents are provisioned as runtime dependencies to the Shell or MCP Server, and will be auto detected and deployed via component scan from the JVM classpath.
In the embabel-agent-api/pom.xml we have two dedicated Maven Profiles designed to bootstrap Kotlin and / or Java Agents.

- **agent-examples-kotlin**
- **agent-examples-java**

Startup scripts are configured to bootstrap Kotlin Example Agents (we will add Java Agents shortly)
   
```
cmd /c mvn -P agent-examples-kotlin -Dmaven.test.skip=true spring-boot:run
```

If you would like to launch Shell as SpringBootApplication from your IDE such as IntelliJ, Maven profile must be selected prior to running Shell.
This can be done via IntelliJ Maven Profile selection (View/Tools/Maven)
